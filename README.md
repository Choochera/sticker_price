# sticker_price
Small python program that attempts to predict stock prices by leveraging either analyst predictions or historical data regarding EPS growth, equity growth and P/E changes from the passed five years.

The calculations used within this program were acquired through the book "Rule #1" authored by Phil Town. The goal is to identify underpriced stocks.
I am not a financial advisor nor am I qualified to give financial advice. The use of the this program and the reliance one gives to its outputs in terms of real
world results is entirely the responsibility of the user.
Also, Thank you!
This was a fun one to write. 
## This program requires the use of an Alpha Vantage API key to access stock market data
